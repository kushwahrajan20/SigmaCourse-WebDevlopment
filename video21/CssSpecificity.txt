*Quick Quiz
What will be the specificity value of the following selector:
a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover 
{
  color: red;
}
*Solution
To calculate the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover, you can break down its components:
Element selectors: a contributes 1 point.
Class selectors: .harryclass and .rohan-class each contributes 10 points, totaling 20 points.
Attribute selector: [href] contributes 10 points.
Pseudo-class: :hover adds another 10 points.
Add up all these values:
1 (element) + 20 (classes) + 10 (attribute) + 10 (pseudo-class) = 41.
So, the specificity value of the selector a.harryclass.rohan-class[href]:hover will be 41.
